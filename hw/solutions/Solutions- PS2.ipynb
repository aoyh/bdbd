However, the families in the study villages had a choice whether to participate in the program; we indicate participants with D_HH. In reality there was an eligibility criterion to participate in PROGRESA in the selected villages, but for this exercise we will assume that all households in treatment villages were eligible. Now, cross-tabulate the frequency of households assigned to the treatment groups and their actual participation. What is the level of compliance?\n",

    "See code and output below. The table shows that approximately 50% of households in the treatment group actually participated in PROGRESA, whereas there are no households from the control group who participated in PROGRESA as per the study protocol. We also find by comparing the output from the regressions that ITT effects (regression of D on Income) are smaller than the per- actual-treatment-status (“treatment on the treated”; TOT) effect, which will be explained in the next section. The ITT effect is likely causal, because the confounders between people “offered” PROGRESA and those who were not can be expected to be well-balanced at the baseline and thus the groups are exchangeable. However, the households who chose to participate may be in more need of the program or find it more convenient to access than those who did not, so that there can be systematic differences or “selection bias” between the people who participated in progress and the people who did not participate. Since the program was randomized, the ITT effect is theoretically protected from selection bias, even though it underestimates the “true impact” of the intervention. Enrollment in the program (D_HH), on the other hand, was not randomized, and therefore the TOT effect can be subject to selection biases."

This happens because in the IV / 2SLS method, the strength with which the IVs are associated with the endogenous participation variable is highly relevant to the estimated 2SLS coefficients. Also, pov_HH may be correlated with unmeasured confounders in the error term, so it may be a bad IV in any case.\n",

    "Overall, in applying the IV/2SLS method it is critical that you find a good IV. How strongly IVs are associated with the endogenous treatment is important, and we must be able to convincingly argue that the IVs are not correlated with measured or unmeasured confounders. For the latter, no statistical tests can be adequate; we will have to rely on compelling and logical arguments. Often  the findings based on IV/2SLS methods are criticized because the IV selection is not well motivated or justified."
