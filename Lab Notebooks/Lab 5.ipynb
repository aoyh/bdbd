    "### Announcements:\n",
    "Reminder that the next problem set is due at the start of lecture next week (February 21).  Solutions for the last problem set are posted!  Grades should be up in bcourses within 1-2 weeks.  A reminder on problem set submission:\n",
    "* Jupyter notebook or R script only\n",
    "* Only assigned exercises\n",
    "* Submit by 9:30am for full credit\n",

    "### Plan for Today's Lab\n",
    "1. Quick discussion of instrumental variables applications (5-10 minutes)\n",
    "2. Checking compliance in R- crosstab (5 minutes)\n",
    "3. IV Regressions in R (5-10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1-Discussion\n",
    "Instrumental variabes are extremely useful when trying test products or programs in the real world, especially in the following situations:\n",
    "### Imperfect Compliance \n",
    "This was discussed in lecture: not everyone does what you tell them to!  It's important to understand that if we try to compare those who received the treatment directly to those who did not (instead of those who were randomly assigned to receive the treatment), our intervention is no longer randomly assigned!  Our estimates may be biased upwards or downwards.  Example: only very poor families choose to take up PROGRESA, so those who are assigned to receive the program but choose not comply to are wealthier/otherwise better off.\n",
    "### Imperfect Compliance By Design\n",
    "Sometimes, you may design an experiment in such a way that you know not everyone in your randomized group will receive the treatment.  For example, you may not be able to limit the sample of randomization only to people who are eligible. Example: Oregon Health Study \n",
    "### Encouragement or \"nudge\" designs\n",
    "It's important to understand the distinction here between the interpretation of the (a) first stage (b) intent to treat effect (c) local average treatment effect/treatment on the treated. With nudges or encouragement programs, we might actually care more about the intent to treat effect, because this is the true effect of the program (esp for cost effectiveness purposes).  In that case IV isn't really necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "While the LATE/TOT can be interpretted casaully, we must remember that it is *local*.  This means that it is estimating the effect *for the group that was actually treated*.  So, we can't extrapolate what the effect would be for the group that was encouraged but didn't take up the treatment if we could somehow force them to take it up. (example: nudge to improve enrollment vs autoenrollment)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Natural experiments\n",
    "We can also use IV in to analyze the effect of programs/products when we're not able to run an experiment.  We just have to find something that randomly induces variation in exposure to the program/product/thing we're trying to understand the effect of. Example: Use years with bad flu season to estimate effects of school absenses on test scores\n"
